<h2> Structure of the experiment </h2>
<ul>
  <li> You will face 10 rounds in this experiment. </li>
  <li> <b>Each round is independent of other rounds</b>. </li>
  <li> <b>Each round is equally likely to be selected for your payment</b>. </li>
  <li> <b>You might be matched with different participants as group members in each round</b>. </li>
  <li> Thus, it is important for you to take each round seriously. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Structure of the round </h2>
<h4>Stage 1:  Information </h4>

                There is a state called the ''unknown state'' that is filled with multiple balls with different colors in two boxes. The state is either the <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong>, including two boxes: <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> and <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>, or the <strong style="color: blue;">''BLUE''</strong>, including two boxes: <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> and <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>. As you can see in the following Figure, the <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong> has more red balls, and the <strong style="color: blue;">''BLUE''</strong> has more blue balls in each box.
<ul>

<div style="text-align: center;">

</div>
<br>
<br>
    <li>Every <b>3 participants</b> in this lab are randomly selected into one group in the beginning of each round. </li>
    <li>We will roll a die and determine the ''unknown state'' - either the <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong> or <strong style="color: red;">''BLUE''</strong>. <b>No one will be told which one is chosen!</b></li>
    <li>You are asked to select a card to reveal a box <strong><em>from the chosen state:</em></strong> </li>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/box.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="70%" style="margin-right: 80px;">
</div>
    <li><strong><em>From the chosen state and your selected box</em></strong>, you are asked to select a ball to reveal its color:</li>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/ball.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="70%" style="margin-right: 80px;">
</div>
    <li>The color of the ball (not <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> or <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>!) you and your group members got will be shown to everyone in your group.</li>
    <li>e.g., if you got a red ball from <strong><em>Box A</em></strong>, and your group members got a red ball and a blue ball, you will be shown the following: </li>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/info.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="70%" style="margin-right: 80px;">
</div>
<br>
<br>
</ul>

<h4>Stage 2: Who you want to connect with</h4>

In this stage, you can gain more information by connecting with at most one voter in your group. How you can connect with other group members depends on your choice and other group members choices in the following task.
<ul>
<br>
    <li>You are asked to rank whom you want to connect with from the most to the least. You will see the following interface:  </li>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/network.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="70%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
    <li>The computer will match you with other group members based on your ranking, i.e. <strong><em>the computer will match you first with the group member you put in the first box, then with the one in the second box, and so on until the last box.</em></strong></li>
    <li>So it is <b>IMPORTANT</b> for you to rank exactly based on who you want to connect with from the most to the least.  </li>
    <li>If you are not successfully connected to any voters in your group, you just wait in the page for one minute. You will see the following screenshot:</li>
    <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/non-chat.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="50%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
</ul>
    <li>If you are successfully connected to another participant, you can (I) see he/she got a ball from which box: either <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> or <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>; (II) freely to chat with him/her for 1 minute. You will see the following screenshot:</li>
    <br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/chat.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="80%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
</ul>

<h4>Stage 3: Voting</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Now you need to vote about which state is chosen in stage 1: <b><span style="color: red;">RED</span></b> or <b><span style="color: blue;">BLUE</span></b>. </li>
<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
   <img src="{% static 'global/vote.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="70%">
</div>
<br>
<br>
    <li>Your payoff is determined by the number of correct votes: If there are majority (2 or 3) participants in your group vote correctly, each of you in the group will earn <strong style="font-size: 24px;">£15！</strong> If there are 0 or 1 participant in your group vote correctly, each of you in the group will only earn <b>£2</b>!</li>
</ul>
