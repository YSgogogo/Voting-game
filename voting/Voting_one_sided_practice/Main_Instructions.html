<h2> Structure of the experiment </h2>
<ul>
  <li> You will face 15 rounds in today's experiment. </li>
  <li> <b>Each round is independent of other rounds</b>. </li>
  <li> <b>Each round is equally likely to be selected for your earnings</b>. </li>
  <li> <b>You might be matched with different participants as group members in each round</b>. </li>
  <li> Thus, it is important for you to take each round seriously. </li>
</ul>

<h2> Structure of the round </h2>
<h4>Stage 1:  Information </h4>

                There is a state called ''unknown state'' that is filled with multiple balls with different colors in two boxes. The state is either the <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong>, which includes two boxes: <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> and <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>, or the <strong style="color: blue;">''BLUE''</strong>, which includes two boxes: <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> and <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>. As you can see in the following Figure, the <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong> has more red balls, and the <strong style="color: blue;">''BLUE''</strong> has more blue balls in each box.
<ul>

</div>
<br>
<br>
    <li>At the beginning of each round, every 5 participants in this lab will be randomly selected into one group, and each participant will be given a unique ID for that round.  </li>
    <li>In your group, the computer will flip a coin (50-50) to determine the “unknown state” - either <strong style="color: red;">''RED''</strong> or <strong style="color: blue;">''BLUE''</strong>. <b>No one will be told which one is actually selected!</b> </li>
    <li>For each of you, the computer will flip a coin (50-50) again to determine a box from the selected state - either <strong><em>Box A</em></strong> or <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>. </li>
    <li>For each of you, the computer will randomly and independently pick a ball from your selected box - either <span class='ball red-ball'></span> or <span class='ball blue-ball'></span> . </li>
    <li>The ball that each group member got will be shown to other group members, <b>BUT</b> the selected box will not be shown to other group members (your box information is private).</li>

    <li> After knowing these information, you are asked to choose whom you want to send your private information (i.e., your box information) to:  </li>
      a) &nbsp send to a player who got <span class='ball red-ball'></span>
<br>
      b) &nbsp send to a player who got <span class='ball blue-ball'></span>
<br>
      c) &nbsp do not send to anyone
<br>
<br>
    <span style="font-size: smaller; font-style: italic;">N.B. 1. If there is more than one group member (except you) who got the same ball, the computer will randomly send your private information to one of them; 2. if no group member (except you) got the red ball, option a) will not be available; if no group member (except you) got the blue ball, option b) will not be available.</span>
<br>
<br>
    <li>e.g., if you got a blue ball from <strong><em>Box B</em></strong>, and your group members: one got a blue ball and three got red balls, you will be shown the following:</li>

<br>
<br>
</ul>

<h4>Stage 2: Voting</h4>

<ul>
    <li>Once all group members have finished Stage 1, you will be shown the following:</li>
    1) &nbsp the left table will have more box information if other group members choose to send their private box information to you.
<br>
    2) &nbsp the network diagram in the middle includes the flow of information.
<br>
    3) &nbsp you need to vote for which state was chosen at the beginning: <b><span style="color: red;">RED</span></b> or <b><span style="color: blue;">BLUE</span></b>.

<br>
    <li>Your earnings: the computer will randomly determine a group member, if he/she votes correctly, each of you in the group will earn <strong style="font-size: 24px;">£15！</strong> If he/she votes incorrectly, each of you in the group will only earn <strong style="font-size: 24px;">£2！</strong></li>
</ul>
