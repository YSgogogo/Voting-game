<p>
At the beginning of each round in Block 3, you will see your own signal source and signal, as
well as the signals of the other group members, but not their signal sources (whether
weak source or strong source). Every group member has a chance to share their own
signal source to only one of other two group members. There are 10 rounds in total. You will
be first shown the following:</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'IndividualDecision/block3_1.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="40%"></div>

<br>
<p>
    The above decision from a randomly selected group member will be implemented. This selected member’s decision may let one group member has information about her signal source. It is <b>important</b> to make your decision carefully, as this may influence the other group members’ final guess (hence your final payment) about the true state in that round.
</p>
<p>
Next, every group member needs to guess the true state based on their available information. The screenshot shows your decision page in a round:
</p>
<div style="text-align:center;"><img src="{% static 'IndividualDecision/block3_2.png' %}" alt="Urns" width="40%"></div>


<br>

<b><span style="font-size: 1.35em;">Payment in Block 3</span></b>


<p>
    At the end of the experiment, the computer will randomly select one round from this block for your payment. In the selected round, every correct guess from a group member will mean
    <strong>£2</strong> is added to the payment for <strong>each group member</strong>,
    every incorrect guess from a group member will mean
    <strong>£0</strong> is added to the payment for <strong>each group member</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Example:</strong><br>
    if round&nbsp;6 is selected, the true state in this round is
    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">RED</span>.
    Three group members correctly guessed state
    <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">RED</span>,
    and zero group member incorrectly guessed state
    <span style="color: blue; font-weight: bold;">BLUE</span>.
    Consequently,
  </p>


</div>




<p class="text-center">your payment in Block&nbsp;3&nbsp;=&nbsp;£2x3+£0x0=6</p>

<p>So, it is important to let more group members make correct guess to maxmize your payment. In other words, you must make your decisions very carefully in sharing your signal source.</p>
